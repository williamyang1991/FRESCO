**Abstract:** *The remarkable efficacy of text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive exploration of their potential application in video domains.
Zero-shot methods seek to extend image diffusion models to videos without necessitating model training.
Recent methods mainly focus on incorporating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint imposed on determining where to attend to valid features can sometimes be insufficient, resulting in temporal inconsistency.
In this paper, we introduce FRESCO, intra-frame correspondence alongside inter-frame correspondence to establish a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a more consistent transformation of semantically similar content across frames. Beyond mere attention guidance, our approach involves an explicit update of features to achieve high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly improving the visual coherence of the resulting translated videos.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in producing high-quality, coherent videos, marking a notable improvement over existing zero-shot methods.*

**Features**:<br>
- **Temporal consistency**: use intra-and inter-frame constraint with better consistency and coverage than optical flow alone.
    - Compared with our previous work [Rerender-A-Video](https://github.com/williamyang1991/Rerender_A_Video), FRESCO is more robust to large and quick motion.
- **Zero-shot**: no training or fine-tuning required.
- **Flexibility**: compatible with off-the-shelf models (e.g., [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet), [LoRA](https://civitai.com/)) for customized translation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/williamyang1991/FRESCO.git
cd FRESCO
```

2. You can simply set up the environment with conda and pip based on [requirements.txt](https://github.com/williamyang1991/FRESCO/blob/main/requirements.txt)
```shell
conda create -n fresco python==3.8.5
conda activate fresco
```
```shell
# for torch 2.1.0
pip install -r requirements1.txt
# for torch 2.0.0
pip install -r requirements2.txt
```
   - We have tested on torch 2.0.0/2.1.0 and diffusers 0.19.3
   - If you use new versions of diffusers, you need to modify [my_forward()](https://github.com/williamyang1991/FRESCO/blob/fb991262615665de88f7a8f2cc903d9539e1b234/src/diffusion_hacked.py#L496)
   


3. Run the installation script. The required models will be downloaded in `./model`, `./src/ControlNet/annotator` and `./src/ebsynth/deps/ebsynth/bin`.
    - Requires access to huggingface.co

```shell
python install.py
```

4. You can run the demo with `run_fresco.py`

```shell
python run_fresco.py ./config/config_music.yaml
```

5. For issues with Ebsynth, please refer to [issues](https://github.com/williamyang1991/Rerender_A_Video#issues)


## (1) Inference

### WebUI (recommended)

```
python webUI.py
```
The Gradio app also allows you to flexibly change the inference options. Just try it for more details. 

Upload your video, input the prompt, select the model and seed, and hit:
- **Run Key Frames**: detect keyframes, translate all keyframes.
- **Run Propagation**: propagate the keyframes to other frames for full video translation
- **Run All**: **Run Key Frames** and **Run Propagation**

Select the model:
- **Base model**: base Stable Diffusion model (SD 1.5)
    - Stable Diffusion 1.5: official model
    - [rev-Animated](https://huggingface.co/stablediffusionapi/rev-animated): a semi-realistic (2.5D) model
    - [realistic-Vision](https://huggingface.co/SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V2.0): a photo-realistic model
    - [flat2d-animerge](https://huggingface.co/stablediffusionapi/flat-2d-animerge): a cartoon model
    - You can add other models on huggingface.co by modifying this [line](https://github.com/williamyang1991/FRESCO/blob/1afcca9c7b1bc1ac68254f900be9bd768fbb6988/webUI.py#L362)

### Command Line

We provide a flexible script `run_fresco.py` to run our method.

Set the options via a config file. For example,
```shell
python run_fresco.py ./config/config_music.yaml
```
We provide some examples of the config in `config` directory.
Most options in the config is the same as those in WebUI.
Please check the explanations in the WebUI section.

We provide a separate Ebsynth python script `video_blend.py` with the temporal blending algorithm introduced in
[Stylizing Video by Example](https://dcgi.fel.cvut.cz/home/sykorad/ebsynth.html) for interpolating style between key frames.
It can work on your own stylized key frames independently of our FRESCO algorithm.
For the details, please refer to our previous work [Rerender-A-Video](https://github.com/williamyang1991/Rerender_A_Video/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#our-ebsynth-implementation)
